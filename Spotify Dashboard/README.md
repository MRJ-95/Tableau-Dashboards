In this project, I have utilised spotify data to perform analysis and understand the underlying trend in data.

This analysis has been further extended into identifying the moods of users based on the types of songs they listen to. The type of songs depends on the features of the songs like danceability, tempo, valence, energy etc. Setting a few thresholds across mixed parameters helped identify 4 categories of mood. Although this is not a research backed thing, it is based on my interpretation of the data and hence showcases data exploration, modeling, analysis and engineering.

I have created the dashboard against a balck background with a green overtone to showcase the spotify theme, hence making it more appealing to use. It has various drill down features and has 3 dashboards to view different features.

An interesting thing I learnt while doing this was the integration of a live song playing feature using the weblinks container. Although, it did not make it to the final dashboard it was is a great feature to have.
