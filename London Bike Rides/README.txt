In this tableau project I have make a small python script and tableau dashboard on the bike sharing data in the city of London. I am a resident of Bloomington currently and its a student town that heavily relies on ebikes like bird and lime. Hence, I was curious about the metrics and the relevant data I found was for London. 

In the python script I and doing a very preliminary exploration of the data and making sure its clean. Then I create a dictionary that helps me map the text to the metrics that was very useful for my dashboard.

The dashboard shows a very dynamic moving average graph that allows users to select a moving average period and duration. It uses the tableau formulae for data manipulation and usage of feature creation extensively. Features like min range, max range, moving average etc.

The dashboard also shows a heatmap of the effect on bike rides based on temperature and wind speed. It also has a tooltip that shows two more graphs instead of simple text and metrics. Even the tooltip graphs have integrated tooltips showing metrics which makes it very interesting and gives an in depth view of the effect of external factors on bike rides.
