In this tableau project, I have utilised the jobs in data field 2024 dataset to create a dashboard.

This was more of an experiment to showcase how colour coding is extremely important. The dashboard although seamless with well integrated filters and insightful graphs, is not very appealing. The simple fact being colour mismatch and using a blue background. I personally find blue for a background to be very dull and odd.

The other motive was to actually understand the job market. Since I am myself a student with interest in data fields, I think this helped me understand the areas and job titles I should be targetting. Also, how different work environments and experience levels affect the salaries and job titles.

Types of Data used: Geographic, numeric and time series.
