In this tableau project, I have created a dashboard for analysing netflix data. It consists of movies and TV shows data. It is a simple dashboard that covers the basics of all the major types of graphs used in tableau.
It also uses data aggregation and has a dynamic filter that allows the user to change the movie/tv show to identify the ratings and how it has been reviewed. This will allow users to make an informed choice on the movies/tv shows they wish to watch and enjoy according to their tastes. 

Types of Data: Geographic, time series, numerical and textual data.
