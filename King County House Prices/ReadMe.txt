In this tableau project, I am trying to implement a calendar feature that control all the other graphs in the dashboard. Using 6 different types of graphs and multiple filters, I am trying to build an interactive price tracking dashboard for customers to easily select the filters they want and accordingly make the choice.

There's a total of 7 sheets:
1) Average Daily sales
2) Map
3) Price
4) Bedrooms
5) Bathrooms
6) Heatmap
7) Calendar (main feature)

The data consists of a feature called date that is in text form. Hence here comes the transformation of text to date data type.

Then I go onto formatting the sheets and making them into the custom colour (#7e0097), to increase the appeal and make them look classy. I personally prefer not having grid lines as they make it easier to look at the graphs and actually get people to look at them.

The calendar widget is made from only the date feature of the dataset. I even went ahead and matched the colour scheme and turned the day names to abbreviations.

Then I have added a few filters and applied them to 4 of the sheets to allow for a seamless experience.
