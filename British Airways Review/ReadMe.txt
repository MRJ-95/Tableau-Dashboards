In this project I have built a British airways review dashboard. This basically allows the company to understand how the airline and its services are being perceived by the customers. This goes deep into the reviews by even allowing to filter them by flight types, month, seat type, aircraft category and country.

Data Types: It contains geographical, time series and textual data.

One interesting thing I learnt in this dashboard was how we can group up insignificant categories. Like for instance the different flight types that had reviews less than 50 were grouped together as the various category.

This can be further extended by using NLP to perform sentiment analysis on the reviews data and forming word clouds and categorizing the positive/negative nature of comments.
